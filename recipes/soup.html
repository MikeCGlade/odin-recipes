        <h2>Tomato Soup</h2>
        <p>
            The incredible contagious tomato soup is known for its tradional abilities to tend to
            the sick. During times of refuge--particularly septmember--the flue typically has spread its
            wings infecting everything in its path. This occassionally leads to stomach aches including
            a broad variety of other unwelcome symptoms. Well soup is the perfect solution because it is
            convienent as well as effective at helping those whose stomachs are turned upsidedown. Below there
            are a few ingredients to begin crafting the perfect tomato soup by <a href="https://natashaskitchen.com/tomato-soup-recipe/">natashaskitchen.</a>

            The soup ingredients are found below:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Butter: </b>use unstalted butter to sautee onions.</li>
            <li><b>Yellow onion: </b>it seems like a ton of onion but it dissapears into the soup adding a balanced sweetness </li>
            <li><b>Garlic: </b>you'll need 1 Tbsp minced from about 3 cloves</li>
            <li><b>Crushed tomatoes: </b> with their juice, preferably San Marzano tomatoes</li>
            <li><b>Chicken stock: </b>for the best flavor use homemade chicken broth</li>
            <li><b>Basil: </b> chop and add 1/4 cup fresh basil, plus more to serve. Basil leaves are easily bruised so chop by stacking a bunch of leaves then roll them into a log and cut into thin strips.</li>
            <li><b>Sugar: </b>It's just 1 Tbsp, but necessary to combat the tomato acidity.</li>
            <li><b>Black pepper: </b>start with 1/2 tsp and add more to taste</li>
            <li><b>Whipping cream: </b>adds a creaminess to the soup and offsets acidity.</li>
            <li><b>Parmesan cheese: </b>adds saltiness to the soup and balances acidity. Adding parmesan adds enough salt and I usually don't add more.</li>
        </ul>
